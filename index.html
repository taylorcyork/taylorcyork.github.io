            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in Biology at Creighton University. 
                    <br>During my time at Creighton, I've had the opportunity to do fun things like research prions,
                    <br> TA Biology courses, and work at a COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic.
                </p>
                <p>Next semester, I'm excited to have the opportunity to attend medical school at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.</p>
                <p>In my free time I enjoy playing chess, watching Formula 1 Racing, and learning new skills (like building this website!) </p>
